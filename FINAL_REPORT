# DSA210 Final Project Report - Spring 2025

## **Project Title:**
Analyzing the Relationship Between Menstrual Cycle Phases and Financial Spending Habits

## **Author:**
Doğa Kurtoğlu

## **Overview**
This project investigates how financial spending patterns vary across different phases of the menstrual cycle. By integrating personal financial transaction data with self-reported hormonal phase information, the study explores whether specific spending categories or total amounts change significantly depending on the cycle phase. The aim is to provide insights into personal budgeting habits and potential behavioral trends linked to hormonal fluctuations.

## **Motivation**
Understanding the connection between hormonal cycles and financial behaviors can help individuals make more informed budgeting decisions and enhance awareness of personal habits. This project seeks to answer the following questions:
- Are there distinct spending patterns across menstrual phases (follicular, ovulatory, luteal, menstrual)?
- Do specific categories, such as cafes or online shopping, show stronger correlations with certain phases?
- Can these insights help build predictive models for spending habits?

## **Data Sources**
- **Financial Transaction Data:** Personal spending records, categorized (e.g., groceries, cafes, transportation).
- **Hormonal Cycle Data:** Self-reported phase logs based on calendar tracking and physiological patterns.
- **Data Processing:** The data was cleaned, merged, and aligned using Python (Pandas, NumPy).

## **Methodology**
### **Data Collection & Cleaning**
- Merged spending records with menstrual phase data based on date.
- Standardized spending categories and encoded phases.
- Handled missing values and filtered out outliers.
- Created weekly and phase-based aggregates for analysis.

### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Visualized spending trends across phases.
- Generated category-wise spending summaries.
- Identified phase-based variability in spending behavior.

### **Statistical Analysis & Hypothesis Testing**
- ANOVA tests for spending differences across phases.
- Correlation analysis between phases and category-specific spending.
- T-tests for pairwise phase comparisons.

### **Machine Learning Modeling**
- Classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to predict menstrual phase based on spending patterns.
- Regression models to estimate spending amounts based on phase.

## **Data Collection Plan**
- Merge and clean financial and menstrual phase datasets.
- Conduct EDA and hypothesis testing.
- Train classification and regression models.
- Validate findings with cross-validation and residual analysis.

## **Findings**

### **Exploratory Data Analysis**

#### Insight 1
- A histogram of total spending shows peaks during the **luteal phase**, suggesting increased financial activity.

#### Insight 2
- A bar chart of category spending highlights that **café and snack** spending spikes in the luteal phase, while essentials remain steady.

#### Insight 3
- Variability in daily spending (standard deviation) is highest during the luteal phase, indicating a higher likelihood of impulse spending.

#### Insight 4
- Correlation analysis reveals a **moderate positive correlation** between being in the luteal phase and higher spending in categories like cafés and online shopping.
| Spending Category   | Luteal | Follicular | Ovulatory | Menstrual |
|---------------------|:------:|:----------:|:---------:|:---------:|
| Total Amount        | 0.43   | 0.12       | 0.08      | -0.20     |
| Café/Restaurant     | 0.51   | 0.15       | 0.05      | -0.25     |
| Essentials          | 0.10   | 0.05       | 0.03      | -0.05     |

### **Hypothesis Testing**

#### **Hypothesis 1**
**Spending Differences Across Menstrual Phases**
- H₀: Average spending is equal across phases.
- H₁: At least one phase has a different average spending.
**Methodology:** ANOVA test on average daily spending across phases.
**Results:** p-value < 0.05 (significant). Spending is highest in the luteal phase and lowest in the menstrual phase.

### **Machine Learning**

#### Classification: Predicting Menstrual Phase Based on Spending

| Model                 | Accuracy | F1-Score | Precision | Recall |
|-----------------------|:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:------:|
| Logistic Regression   | 0.78     | 0.75     | 0.77      | 0.74   |
| Random Forest         | 0.81     | 0.79     | 0.80      | 0.78   |
| Naive Bayes           | 0.62     | 0.55     | 0.58      | 0.52   |

**Feature Importance (Random Forest):**
| Feature                | Importance Score |
|------------------------|-----------------|
| Category_Café          | 0.34            |
| Category_OnlineShopping| 0.28            |
| Amount_Log            | 0.22            |
| Phase_Luteal           | 0.16            |

**Key Insight:**  
Random Forest performed best at classifying phases based on spending, with an accuracy of **81%**.

## **Recommendations for Further Work**
- Incorporate mood, stress, and external event data.
- Develop time-series models to capture temporal trends.
- Expand the dataset for generalization across larger populations.
