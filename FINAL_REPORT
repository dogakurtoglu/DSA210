# DSA210 Final Project Report - Spring 2025

## **Project Title:**
Analyzing the Relationship Between Menstrual Cycle Phases and Financial Spending Habits

## **Author:**
Doğa Kurtoğlu

## **Overview**
This project investigates how financial spending patterns vary across different phases of the menstrual cycle. By integrating personal financial transaction data with self-reported hormonal phase information, the study explores whether specific spending categories or total amounts change significantly depending on the cycle phase. The aim is to provide insights into personal budgeting habits and potential behavioral trends linked to hormonal fluctuations.

## **Motivation**
Understanding the connection between hormonal cycles and financial behaviors can help individuals make more informed budgeting decisions and enhance awareness of personal habits. This project seeks to answer the following questions:
- Are there distinct spending patterns across menstrual phases (follicular, ovulatory, luteal, menstrual)?
- Do specific categories, such as cafes or online shopping, show stronger correlations with certain phases?
- Can these insights help build predictive models for spending habits?

## **Data Sources**
- **Financial Transaction Data:** Personal spending records, categorized (e.g., groceries, cafes, transportation).
- **Hormonal Cycle Data:** Self-reported phase logs based on calendar tracking and physiological patterns.
- **Data Processing:** The data was cleaned, merged, and aligned using Python (Pandas, NumPy).

## **Methodology**
### **Data Collection & Cleaning**
- Merged spending records with menstrual phase data based on date.
- Standardized spending categories and encoded phases.
- Handled missing values and filtered out outliers.
- Created weekly and phase-based aggregates for analysis.
