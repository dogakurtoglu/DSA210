# **DSA210 PROJECT**  
## **Project: Hormonal Cycle and Spending Habits**  
## **Overview**
This project aims to analyze how hormonal cycle phases influence personal spending habits. By categorizing weekly expenditures and correlating them with different phases of the hormonal cycle, the project will uncover potential patterns and trends in financial behavior.

## **Motivation**
There is a common perception that women's financial behaviors are unpredictable due to hormonal fluctuations throughout their cycle. However, this assumption lacks empirical validation. This project seeks to challenge this notion by analyzing whether spending habits follow a **predictable pattern** in relation to hormonal phases. By systematically examining expenditure trends across different cycle phases, I aim to determine whether financial decisions are influenced by biological rhythms in a structured and measurable way.
The findings of this study could contribute to:  
- **Personal Finance Strategies:** Understanding how biological cycles may affect budgeting.  
- **Behavioral Economics:** Exploring the relationship between hormonal cycles and financial decision-making.  

## **Data Sources**  
- **Personal Spending Data:** Extracted from **bank transaction records**, categorized into:  
  - Food  
  - Personal care  
  - Entertainment  
  - Utilities  
  - Health-related expenses  
  - Miscellaneous purchases  

- **Hormonal Cycle Tracking Data:** Extracted from **Apple Health**,**menstrual cycle phases**, including:  
  - **Follicular Phase**  
  - **Ovulatory Phase**  
  - **Luteal Phase**  
  - **Menstrual Phase**  
  These phases will be tracked using a **period tracking app or manual records**.  
## **Methodology**  

1. **Data Extraction & Cleaning:**  
   - **Extracting** transaction data from **bank records** and categorizing spending.  
   - Aligning **weekly spending data** with the corresponding hormonal phase.  
   - Ensuring **data completeness and consistency** across the tracking period.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Descriptive statistics to compare spending patterns across different hormonal phases.  
   - Visualizing **spending fluctuations** across cycle phases.  

3. **Correlation & Statistical Analysis:**  
   - Conducting **hypothesis tests (T-Test, ANOVA, correlation analysis)** to determine statistically significant spending changes across different phases.  
   - Identifying **spending peaks or trends** during specific hormonal phases.  

4. **Insights & Interpretation:**  
   - Understanding **how hormonal fluctuations influence financial decisions**.  
   - Exploring possible strategies for **budgeting and self-awareness** in spending behaviors.  

5. **Predictive Modeling:**  
  - If patterns are observed, applying **time series forecasting or classification models** to predict spending behavior based on hormonal cycle data.  


## **Data Collection Plan**
- **Personal spending records** will be maintained manually or extracted from banking apps.
- **Hormonal cycle tracking** will be recorded using a health app or manually inputted based on an estimated cycle timeline.
- Data will be collected over a period of several weeks to ensure enough variation across different phases.

## **Expected Outcomes**
- Identification of spending categories most influenced by hormonal phases.
- Insights into behavioral patterns related to financial decision-making.
- Potential applications in personal finance management and awareness.
